The Earth is a viscous fluid body, rotating in space about its axis that passes through the poles
and centre of mass, and this axis of revolution is inclined to its orbital plane of rotation about
the Sun. The combination of gravitational and rotational forces causes the Earth to be slightly
flattened at the poles, and the gently undulating equipotential surfaces of the Earth's gravity
field also have this characteristic. A particular equipotential surface, the geoid, represents
global mean sea level, and since the seas and oceans cover approximately 70% of the Earth's
surface, the geoid is a close approximation of the Earth's true shape. The geoid is a gently
undulating surface that is difficult to define mathematically and hence is not a useful
reference surface for computation.
A better reference surface is an ellipsoid, which in geodesy is taken to mean a surface of
revolution created by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis. Ellipsoids, with particular
geometric properties, can be located in certain ways so as to be approximations of the global
geoid, or approximations of regional portions of the geoid; this gives rise to geocentric or
local reference ellipsoids. In any case, the size and shape of ellipsoids are easily defined
mathematically and they are relatively simple surface to compute upon; although not as
simple as the sphere. Knowledge of the geometry of the ellipsoid and its generator, the
ellipse, is an important part of the study of geodesy
An ellipse is a geometric shape with many practical applications in astronomy, geodesy and
geomatics engineering. It belongs to the family of conic sections, formed by the intersection
of a right circular cone and a plane at an angle that is not perpendicular to the coneâ€™s axis.
